    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong lang="es-PY">Tereré</strong> (ka'ay in Guarani), the national drink of Paraguay, is similar to an iced herbal tea, except it is prepared with cold water instead of being brewed with hot water, then cooled.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Millions of modern-day Guarani all over South America still drink yerba mate, with time-honored rituals and customs persisting to this day; most notably, drinking yerba mate and <em lang="es-PY">tereré</em> with a group of friends or family gathered in a circle. This practice, symbolic of friendship and acceptance, begins with the <em lang="es-PY">cebador/a</em> (the person making the <strong lang="es-PY">yerba/tereré</strong>) preparing the beverage, and drinking the first infusion him or herself. Why? Because the first one can be bitter, so you don’t want to be serving that to your guests!</p>
