    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong lang="es-PY">Sopa paraguaya</strong> is a delicious traditional cheesy cornbread from Paraguay, which is prepared with corn flour, cheese, milk and onions. It is traditionally served with meats as well as soups.</p>
    
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>When the Spaniards arrived to Guarani lands, the natives received them with honors and offered them their best food to entertain them: game meat. When the meat ran out, and as the guests were still hungry, the Guaranis served them the food they usually ate, which was made with corn flour (or cassava) wrapped in banana leaves, cooked on fire. As they served their food, they shouted <em lang="es-PY">“So’o opa”</em>, which is Guarani for “the meat is finished”. The Spaniards understood <em lang="es-PY">“sopa”</em> and the rest is history!</p>
