# The Odin Project Recipes

The current project is about recipes and the skill I will acquire or have demonstrate is using:

- Paragraphs
- Headings
- Lists
- Links and Images
- Committing in Git
- And so on...

We do not have any layout or something about to create a good structure for HTML, but we could improvise anyway.

## Recipes

We have the following recipes:

1. Sopa Paraguaya
2. Chipa
3. Chipa Guazú
4. Tereré

Maybe the fourth one isn't a dish precisely, but it's delicious!
